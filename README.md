## Fishy Business
Fishy Business is a project for a class that was centered on computer organization. Similar to computer architecture, the focus was on the integration of physical components and software computing. With that being said, Fishy Business is a project that was an integration of a python FLASK app with a web server and interface, and physical components. Our components are a few different stepper moters and motor drivers hooked up to two Raspberry Pi's. The result of the project was an interactive fishing game where you used web controls that directed the moters in different ways to move a 3D-printed fishing pole, which then had string on the end of it and you were trying to pick up magnetic fish that we also designed. 

This was a 3 person team of developers and the project spanned over a long period of time. We also had to manage finances, communicate with our manager throughout our project, and provide clear milestones with progress reports biweekly. There was a ton of time and effort put into this project, and you can see more here: (Google Docs PDF)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UDsRC2ACJXGYOD87r-1AtN0rV3N91Ex5absoSoETT_Q/edit?usp=sharing]
